My Bio Page
A personal bio page showcasing my skills, hobbies, and contact information.

Project Overview
This project is a simple web page built using HTML, CSS, and a touch of personality. The page is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with a focus on showcasing my skills, hobbies, and contact information.

Positioning
One of the key features of this project is the use of positioning to create a visually appealing layout. The page uses a combination of flexbox and grid to position elements in a way that is both responsive and easy to read.

The header section uses flexbox to position the title and navigation links in a horizontal row.
The intro section uses grid to position the background image and text in a way that is both responsive and visually appealing.
The bio container section uses flexbox to position the bio, skills, hobbies, and contact information in a vertical column.
CSS Selectors
This project uses a variety of CSS selectors to target and style different elements on the page. Some of the most notable selectors include:

.intro : Targets the intro section and styles the background image and text.
.bio-container : Targets the bio container section and styles the layout and positioning of the bio, skills, hobbies, and contact information.
.bio, .skills, .hobbies, .contact : Targets the individual bio, skills, hobbies, and contact information sections and styles the layout and positioning of each section.
